# What is NDC live test?
The NDC live test is originally named for deploying the first data dashboard online. Now, we are stuck with that name. The purpose of these scripts is that the website hosting, Netlify, reads these and transform these into what the public can see. This is a **[website](https://www.nationaldeafcenter.org/dashboard)** you can see right now. In other words, if updating this data dashboard, everyone in the public can see. Please handle this information with care.
