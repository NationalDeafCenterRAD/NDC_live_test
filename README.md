# What is NDC live test?
The NDC live test is originally named for deploying the first data dashboard online. Now, we are stuck with that name. The real purpose of these scripts is that the website hosting, Netlify, transforms these into what the public can see. This is a **[website](https://www.nationaldeafcenter.org/dashboard)** you can see right now. This website is from Netlify and the Netlify obtains information from here. In other words, if you make any changes in this data dashboard, everyone in the public can see. Please handle this information with care.

If you are one responsible for maintaining and updating this information, please enter this **[GitHub website](https://github.com/NationalDeafCenterRAD/Data_Dashboard2021)**
